            Wolbachia is an infection that is used to control the population of
            mosquitoes as well as reduce their disease-carrying capabilities.
            Viruses such as Zika and Dengue are inhibited by the presence of
            Wolbachia, and other animals and humans are not affected by the
            infection when bitten. This makes it a very useful and practical
            method of disease prevention in areas with high mosquito
            populations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The students test for Wolbachia by collecting a variety of insects
            around their area. This is done by first extracting the DNA from the
            insects, then running it through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to
            increase the quantity of genetic material to a human-visible amount.
            Afterwards, the strands are separated by Gel Electrophoresis, a
            polarity-based separation technique used to search for genetic
            markers that indicate the presence of an infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once done, teachers and other program leaders can compile their data
            onto our interactive map to give us a better understanding of how
            Wolbachia has spread throughout the country.
          </p>

              The Bay Area Bioscience Education Community (BABEC) is a nonprofit
              dedicated to providing teachers with the support, resources, and
              networking opportunities they need to educate students in biotech
              and prepare the next generation of scientists. They have partnered
              with over 300 schools around the country and given over 1,500,000
              students the chance to develop their scientific skills.
